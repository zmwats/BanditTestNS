Welcome to OverTheWire!


If you find any problems, please report them to the #wargames channel on
discord or IRC.


--[ Playing the games ]--


  This machine might hold several wargames.
  If you are playing "somegame", then:


        * USERNAMES are somegame0, somegame1, ...
        * Most LEVELS are stored in /somegame/.
        * PASSWORDS for each level are stored in /etc/somegame_pass/.


  Write-access to homedirectories is disabled. It is advised to create a
  working directory with a hard-to-guess name in /tmp/.  You can use the
  command "mktemp -d" in order to generate a random and hard to guess
  directory in /tmp/.  Read-access to both /tmp/ is disabled and to /proc
  restricted so that users cannot snoop on eachother. Files and directories
  with easily guessable or short names will be periodically deleted! The /tmp
  directory is regularly wiped.
  Please play nice:


        * don't leave orphan processes running
        * don't leave exploit-files laying around
        * don't annoy other players
        * don't post passwords or spoilers
        * again, DONT POST SPOILERS!
          This includes writeups of your solution on your blog or website!


--[ Tips ]--


  This machine has a 64bit processor and many security-features enabled
  by default, although ASLR has been switched off.  The following
  compiler flags might be interesting:


        -m32                        compile for 32bit
        -fno-stack-protector        disable ProPolice
        -Wl,-z,norelro              disable relro


  In addition, the execstack tool can be used to flag the stack as
  executable on ELF binaries.


  Finally, network-access is limited for most levels by a local
  firewall.


--[ Tools ]--


 For your convenience we have installed a few useful tools which you can find
 in the following locations:


        * gef (https://github.com/hugsy/gef) in /opt/gef/
        * pwndbg (https://github.com/pwndbg/pwndbg) in /opt/pwndbg/
        * peda (https://github.com/longld/peda.git) in /opt/peda/
        * gdbinit (https://github.com/gdbinit/Gdbinit) in /opt/gdbinit/
        * pwntools (https://github.com/Gallopsled/pwntools)
